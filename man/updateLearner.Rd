\title{Update an R learner with new data.}
\usage{
updateLearner(.learner, .model, .newdata = NULL, .task, .truth, .weights, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{.learner}{\link{\code{\link{RLearner}}}\cr
Wrapped learner.}

\item{.model}{\link{\code{\link{WrappedModel}}}\cr
Model produced by training.}

\item{.newdata}{\link{\code{data.frame}}\cr
New data to predict. Does not include target column.}

\item{.task}{\link{\code{Task}}
The model's task}

\item{.truth}{\link{\code{data.frame}}
A vector of data that is to be predicted.}

\item{.weights}{\link{\code{data.frame}}
Optional, non-negative case weight vector to be used during fitting.
If given, must be of same length as \code{subset} and in corresponding order.
By default \code{NULL} which means no weights are used unless specified in the task (\code{\link{Task}}).
Weights from the task will be overwritten.}

\item{...}{\link{any}\cr
Additional parameters, which need to be passed to the underlying predict function.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item For classification: Either a factor with class labels for type
\dQuote{response} or, if the learner supports this, a matrix of class probabilities
for type \dQuote{prob}. In the latter case the columns must be named with the class
labels.
\item For regression or forecast regressions: Either a numeric vector for type \dQuote{response} or,
if the learner supports this, a matrix with two columns for type \dQuote{se}.
In the latter case the first column contains the estimated response (mean value)
and the second column the estimated standard errors.
\item For survival: Either a numeric vector with some sort of orderable risk
for type \dQuote{response} or, if supported, a numeric vector with time dependent
probabilities for type \dQuote{prob}.
\item For clustering: Either an integer with cluster IDs for type \dQuote{response}
or, if supported, a matrix of membership probabilities for type \dQuote{prob}.
\item For multilabel: A logical matrix that indicates predicted class labels for type
\dQuote{response} or, if supported, a matrix of class probabilities for type
\dQuote{prob}. The columns must be named with the class labels.

\description{
Mainly for internal use. Update a model with new data.
You have to implement this method if you want to add another learner to this package.
}
\details{
Your implementation must adhere to the following:
Updates to the observations in \code{.newdata} must be made based on the fitted
model (\code{.model$learner.model}).
All parameters in \code{...} must be passed to the underlying predict function.
}
